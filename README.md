## Hi, I'm Faiza Siddiqui ðŸ‘‹

I started my career in Quality Assurance (QA) in 2019 and have been passionate about delivering high-quality software ever since. Over the years, I've been determined to grow and evolve in the QA field, and today, I work as a Test Automation Engineer.

My experience spans across both manual and automated testing. I specialize in building robust and efficient test automation frameworks using tools like Cypress, Playwright, and Postman. I enjoy finding smart ways to ensure software reliability and improving testing processes to support fast-paced development environments.

I'm committed to continuous learning and always eager to explore new technologies and best practices in automation testing.
